## Running Tests

XaleDB includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and correctness. Tests cover all major components of the database engine.

### Build and Run Tests

```sh
# Build the project including tests
cmake -B ./build
cmake --build ./build

# Run the test suite
./build/xale-db-tests
```

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized by component:

- __Storage Tests__: File management and storage engine functionality
  - `FileManagerTests.h` - Binary file operations
  - `StorageEngineTests.h` - Storage engine operations

- __Data Structure Tests__: Core data structures
  - `BPlusTreeTests.h` - B+ tree indexing operations

- __Query Tests__: Query parsing and tokenization
  - `BasicTokenizerTests.h` - SQL tokenization
  - `BasicParserTests.h` - SQL parsing

- __Execution Tests__: Query execution components
  - `TableManagerTests.h` - Table management operations
  - `BasicExecutorTests.h` - SQL statement execution

## Test Framework

Tests use a custom lightweight testing framework defined in `TestsHelper.h`:

- __Registration__: Tests are automatically registered using the `DECLARE_TEST` macro
- __Execution__: All tests run sequentially with pass/fail reporting
- __Output__: Clear console output showing test results

### Writing New Tests

To add a new test:

1. Create a test header file in the appropriate subdirectory under `tests/`
2. Include `TestsHelper.h`
3. Define your test using the `DECLARE_TEST` macro:

```cpp
#include "TestsHelper.h"

DECLARE_TEST(ComponentName, TestName) {
    // Your test code here
    return true; // or false if test fails
}
```

4. Include your test header in `tests/main.cpp`

## Test Configuration

During test execution:
- Logger output is disabled to keep test output clean
- A temporary test file (`test-storage-file-unit-tests.bin`) is created for storage tests
- Tests are isolated and do not affect production data
